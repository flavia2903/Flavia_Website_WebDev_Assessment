        <h2>Reflective Discussion on experience with the Web Development module</h2>
        <p>As this was my second time learning HTML and CSS, I had previously attempted to learn online but was unsuccessful. 
          However, this module has taught me how to create forms and layouts more efficiently and with fewer difficulties. 
          I now feel more confident structuring web pages and implementing design elements effectively.
        </p>
        <h3>Design Decisions</h3>
        <p>When I designed my website, my goal was to create something clean to see and a user-friendly layout by ensuring the 
          text was clear and that navigation was straightforward. One of my key decisions was implementing a responsive design 
          to ensure the website functions well on different screen sizes. Additionally, I opted for a minimalistic design to enhance
           user experience by reducing clutter and improving content visibility. For example, West Northampton Council:
        </p>
        <img id="northampton" src="north_council_website.jpg" alt="northampton">
        <h3>Font and Colour Choices</h3>
        <p>My decision to select fonts and colours for my website was based on my style, minimalist and straightforward. 
          I chose a design that is clear, easy to read, and effective in transmitting my message. My goal was to showcase 
          my work, not just as another university assessment but as a portfolio that could support me in reaching my first
           job in the field. For example, of Jack Parsons, in GitHub.
        </p>
        <img id="jack" src="jack_parsons.jpg" alt="jack">
        <h3>Sources of Inspiration</h3>
        <p>I search various sources, including online tutorials, design blogs, and existing websites, including the University 
          of Northampton. Feedback from potential users in the future, for example, friends and coworkers who did not know how to
          create a website but use it in day-to-day life, also influenced my design choices, allowing me to refine elements for better usability.
          Overall, this module has been an enriching experience, equipping me with essential web development skills.
